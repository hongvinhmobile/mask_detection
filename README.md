# mask_detection_python

This is a mask detection application using Python and OpenCV. The application uses a Deep Learning model to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The model is trained using a dataset of images of people wearing and not wearing masks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lambiengcode/mask_detection_python.git
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:

```bash
python detect_mask_video.py
```

## Usage

The application will use your default camera to capture frames and detect if a person is wearing a mask or not. The application will draw a rectangle around the face and indicate if a mask is detected or not.

##Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the need to detect mask-wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The deep learning model used in this project was trained using the [Face Mask Detection](https://github.com/lambiengcode/mask_detection_python) dataset.
